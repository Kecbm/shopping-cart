## Skills

In this project, I was able to:

- Make requests to an API *(Application Programming Interface)* from Mercado Livre;
- Use my knowledge of JavaScript, CSS and HTML;
- Work with asynchronous functions;
- Implement unit tests.

## What was developed

In this project I developed a completely dynamic **shopping cart**! And the best: consuming data directly from an **API!** That's right. From the English acronym _Application Programming Interface_, an API is a point of contact on the internet with a certain service. Through **HTTP requests** to this API it is possible to interact with it in the way whoever created it planned. Here we will use the Mercado Livre API to search for products for sale.
